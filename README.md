### Overview
The code implements various game theory functions to analyze strategies and payoffs for a two-player game based on a payoff matrix. The code provides functions for finding Nash equilibria, dominant strategies, and maximin/minimax strategies.

### Code Explanation

#### 1. **Matrix Setup and Input Parsing**
```python
matrix_size = int(input())
player_1_payoffs = []
player_2_payoffs = []

# Taking inputs for each player's payoffs
for i in range(matrix_size):
    x = input().split()
    player_1_payoffs.append(list(map(float, x)))

for i in range(matrix_size):
    x = input().split()
    player_2_payoffs.append(list(map(float, x)))
```
- `matrix_size`: Defines the number of strategies for each player.
- `player_1_payoffs` and `player_2_payoffs`: These lists hold the payoff values for each player's strategies.

#### 2. **Flattening the Payoff Matrices**
```python
from itertools import chain

player_1_payoffs = list(chain.from_iterable(player_1_payoffs))
player_2_payoffs = list(chain.from_iterable(player_2_payoffs))
```
- The payoff lists are flattened to simplify indexing.

#### 3. **Constructing a Matrix of Payoffs**
```python
matrix = [[] for _ in range(matrix_size)]
i = 0
for j in range(len(player_1_payoffs)):
    matrix[i].append([player_1_payoffs[j], player_2_payoffs[j]])
    if (j + 1) % matrix_size == 0:
        i += 1
```
- `matrix`: A structured 2D list where each cell holds the payoffs for both players for a specific strategy pair.

#### 4. **Helper Function: `strategy_pay_off`**
```python
def strategy_pay_off(player_1_strategy, player_2_strategy, pay_off_matrix, indexed_player=None) -> [int, int]:
    if indexed_player and indexed_player == 2:
        return pay_off_matrix[player_2_strategy - 1][player_1_strategy - 1]
    return pay_off_matrix[player_1_strategy - 1][player_2_strategy - 1]
```
- This function returns the payoffs for a specific strategy pair, with flexibility to return results based on indexing.

#### 5. **Finding the Best Response**
```python
def best_response(player, other_player_move, pay_off_matrix):
    # Function to determine the best response of a player to the opponent's move.
```
- For each strategy of the opponent, it computes the response values and returns the strategies that yield the maximum response.

#### 6. **Nash Equilibrium Calculation**
```python
def nash_equilibrium(pay_off_matrix):
    # Iterates over each strategy to find strategy pairs where each player has no incentive to deviate.
```
- This function identifies pairs of strategies (Nash equilibria) where neither player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy.

#### 7. **Dominant Strategy Functions**
- **Strongly Dominant Strategy**:
  ```python
  def strongly_dominant_strategy(player, pay_off_matrix):
      # Returns the strongly dominant strategy if it exists, meaning one strategy consistently outperforms others.
  ```
- **Weakly Dominant Strategy**:
  ```python
  def weakly_dominant_strategy(player, pay_off_matrix):
      # Returns the weakly dominant strategy if it exists, where one strategy is at least as good as others.
  ```

#### 8. **Dominant Strategy Equilibria**
- **Strongly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium**:
  ```python
  def strongly_dominant_strategy_equilibrium(pay_off_matrix):
      # Checks if both players have a unique strongly dominant strategy, implying a strongly dominant strategy equilibrium.
  ```
- **Weakly Dominant Strategy Equilibrium**:
  ```python
  def weakly_dominant_strategy_equilibrium(pay_off_matrix):
      # Checks if both players have a unique weakly dominant strategy, implying a weakly dominant strategy equilibrium.
  ```

#### 9. **Maximin and Minimax Strategies**
- **Maximin Strategy**:
  ```python
  def max_min_value_strategy(player, pay_off_matrix):
      # Calculates the maximin strategy, the maximum of the minimum payoffs for each player's strategies.
  ```
- **Minimax Strategy**:
  ```python
  def min_max_value_strategy(player, pay_off_matrix):
      # Determines the minimax strategy, the minimum of the maximum payoffs for each player's strategies.
  ```

#### Example Input
```
3
6 8 0
10 4 2
11 20 4
6 20 8
0 5 8
0 0 4
```
- Represents payoffs for each strategy of players 1 and 2 for a 3x3 game.
